      <p class="text-justify">
        This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics tool service
        provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses Cookies
        to help the website analyse how users use the site. The information

      <h3 class="text-center">Usage of Facebook Social Plugins </h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Our website uses social plugins (“plugins”) from the social networking site facebook.com, 
        operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 South California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). 
        The plugins can be identified by one of Facebook’s logos (a white "f" on a blue tile or a “thumbs-up”
        icon), or the phrase “Facebook Social Plugin”. The list of Facebook social plugins and their appearances
        can be found here.
        In case you access a website of our internet presence using such a plugin, your browser will contact 
        the Facebook server and load the visual presentation of the plugin as well as present it to you. 
        During this exercise, the Facebook server receives information concerning your visit of the website 
        of our internet presence as well as further data like your IP address. Facebook transmits the content 
        of the then visible plugin directly to your browser and integrates it into the page on our website. 
        We therefore have no influence on the amount of data that Facebook is able to collect using these plugins.
        Information concerning the subject matter is made available by Facebook here.
        These activated plugins allow Facebook to know that you have visited this particular page on our website.
        If you are logged in to Facebook at the time, it can associate your visit to the page to your Facebook 
        account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking the 'Like’ button or by posting 
        a comment, the information you give is then sent directly to Facebook and saved there.
        If you do not have a Facebook account, it is still possible for Facebook to identify and store your IP 
        address after you have clicked the Facebook note.
        To find out more about the reasons why and the extent to which Facebook collects data,
        how the data is further processed and used, your rights in the matter, and settings options you 
        can choose that protect your privacy, please see Facebook's Data Protection Policy.
        <br>
        If you have a Facebook account and do not want Facebook to collect data about you from our website
        and connect it to your member data saved on Facebook, you must log out of Facebook before visiting 
        our website and clicking the Facebook note.
        It is also possible to block Facebook social plugins by using add-ons for your browser.
