        Hangload is a patented system that is designed to carry bags of various shapes 
        and sizes on the rear rack of bicycles. 
        <br> <br>
        Shopping bags, rucksacks, sport bags, travel bags,
        in fact most bags with a handle can be carried on a Hangload.
        <br> <br>
        It has always been our intention to produce a useful, stylish and inexpensive product to give 
        cyclists a new option for carrying various sized bags and so making it even more convenient 
        to go by bike!  
        <br><br>
        The whole principle is based on simplicity and practicality using the most suitable means
        to ensure a high performance and quality at a low cost.

      <h3 class="text-center">Darius Hajiani</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Settled in Berlin in 2007. For the first time in his life he was impressed 
        by how in a city he could comfortably get around by bike and did not require a car.
        He very much felt the pleasure  and benefits of using his bicycle on a daily basis.
        The only drawback for him was that he could not find a suitable carrying device that
        enabled him to get his things about without fuss or a huge expense and fear of theft.
        He started thinking...<br>
        After much prototyping with many cardboard boxes over a period of time he came 
        up with a solution that worked very well. He learnt metal work and much about textile 
        sewing and looking into the most ecological plastic for this purpose and so the Hangload 
        was developed. <br>
        He uses his  every day whether shopping, transporting all types of work materials, 
        going for a picknick or even getting his heavy rucksack around town. Developing the
        Hangload would not have been possible without a Hangload!
