      </h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Darius Hajiani is the son of an iranian father and an english mother.
        He moved to Berlin in early 2004 because of his daughter. In Berlin he
        was amazed by the ability to live without the car and this was the
        first time in his life when he did not own a car anymore. However he
        always felt uncomfortable carrying load with the bicycle and he
        wondered why there is no device which properly handles different types
        of bags without being to expensive or limited to specific fixed
        bags. So he started working on the Hangload and after seven years he
        finally sorted out all major problems and got the best solution which
        fits the needs of the customers, the environment and local businesses.
        His dream is to make the Hangload public to all people and make the
        world a better place by having access to the Hangload as useful
        helper for any load you want to carry per bike.

      </h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Originally hailing from San Francisco where he studied music business,
        Matthew moved to Berlin in the summer of 2013. He began his career in
        social media in San Francisco as an intern, where he was in charge of
        social media at two renowned record labels. Upon moving to Berlin he
        has continued to work in social media in the music and entertainment
        industry. As Berlin is a biking city Matthew found a new love for
        riding a bicycle as a means of transportation and through his newfound
        love began to branch his social media experience out past the music
        industry. He is happy and excited to be a part of the Hangload team to
        explore this new medium.
