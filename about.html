Hangload provides a new and patented system to load different bag sizes and shapes
on your bike. Individal adjustments of size or color of the banner can meet
the costumer requirements. 
 <br>
It was the idea from the beginning, to produce a Hangload as cheap as possible, but with
high quality, environmentally friendly and with local production. <br>
Hangload was designed, that the costumer can easily replace damaged or lost parts
by himself.  
<br>
Hangload wants to offer the possibility to load all sorts of formats of bags (as long as
they have a handle) on your bike - affordable for everyone.

      <p class="text-justify">
        Darius Hajiani moved to Berlin in early 2004. In Berlin he
        was amazed by the ability to live without the car. However he
        always felt uncomfortable carrying load with the bicycle and he
        wondered why there is no device which properly handles different types
        of bags without being to expensive or limited to specific fixed
        bags. So he started working on the Hangload and got the best solution which
        fits the needs of the customers, the environment and local businesses.

      <p class="text-justify">
        Maria Slaby is a young woman living in Berlin who is interested in nature,
        sustainability and new ways of living in a city. She studied meteorology
        and physical geography and is now member of our team. She is riding by bike
        since primary school and is really enjoying the thought of not needing a particular 
        bike bag instead of using the hangload. To find out more about Maria look <a href="//xing.com/profile/Maria_Slaby">here</a>.

      <p class="text-justify">
        Originally hailing from San Francisco where he studied music business,
        Matthew moved to Berlin in the summer of 2013. He began his career in
        social media in San Francisco as an intern, where he was in charge of
        social media at two renowned record labels. Upon moving to Berlin he
        has continued to work in social media in the music and entertainment
        industry. As Berlin is a biking city Matthew found a new love for
        riding a bicycle as a means of transportation and through his newfound
        love began to branch his social media experience out past the music
        industry. He is happy and excited to be a part of the Hangload team to
        explore this new medium.
