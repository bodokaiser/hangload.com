Hangload is a patented system that is designed to carry conventional bags of various shapes 
and sizes on the rear rack of bicycles. Shopping bags, rucksacks, sport bags, travel bags,
in fact most bags with a handle can be carried on a Hangload.
 <br>
It has always been our intention to produce a useful, stylish and inexpensive product to give 
cyclists a new option for carrying various sized bags and so making it even more convenient 
to go by bike!  
<br>
The whole principle is based on simplicity and practicality using the most suitable means
to ensure a high performance and quality at a low cost.

      <h3 class="text-center">Darius Hajiani</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Settled in Berlin in 2007. For the first time in his life he was impressed 
        by how in a city he could comfortably get around by bike and did not require a car.
        He very much felt the pleasure  and benefits of using his bicycle on a daily basis.
        The only drawback for him was that he could not find a suitable carrying device that
        enabled him to get his things about without fuss or a huge expense and fear of theft.
        He started thinking...<br>
        After much prototyping with many cardboard boxes over a period of time he came 
        up with a solution that worked very well. He learnt metal work and much about textile 
        sewing and looking into the most ecological plastic for this purpose and so the Hangload 
        was developed. <br>
        He uses his  every day whether shopping, transporting all types of work materials, 
        going for a picknick or even getting his heavy rucksack around town. Developing the
        Hangload would not have been possible without a Hangload!

      <p class="text-justify">
        Maria Slaby is a young woman living in Berlin who is interested in nature,
        sustainability and new ways of living in a city. She studied meteorology
        and physical geography and is now member of our team. She is riding by bike
        since primary school and is really enjoying the thought of not needing a particular 
        bike bag instead of using the hangload. To find out more about Maria look <a href="//xing.com/profile/Maria_Slaby">here</a>.

      <p class="text-justify">
        Originally hailing from San Francisco where he studied music business,
        Matthew moved to Berlin in the summer of 2013. He began his career in
        social media in San Francisco as an intern, where he was in charge of
        social media at two renowned record labels. Upon moving to Berlin he
        has continued to work in social media in the music and entertainment
        industry. As Berlin is a biking city Matthew found a new love for
        riding a bicycle as a means of transportation and through his newfound
        love began to branch his social media experience out past the music
        industry. He is happy and excited to be a part of the Hangload team to
        explore this new medium.
