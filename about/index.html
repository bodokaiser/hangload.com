  <h1>About Hangload</h1>

  <p>Hangload was invented by Darius Hajiani, a UK-expat living in Berlin. 
    He was looking for a better way to transport grocery bags by bicycle. 
    After researching, experimenting with different materials,and extensive testing, he came up with the patented Hangload system.</p>  

  <p>Invented and created in Berlin, Hangload was a finalist at the Innovation Price Berlin (Innovationpreis Berlin Brandenburg) 
    and garnered media interest.</p>

  <p>Hangload was invited to exhibit at the VeloBerlin generating much interest and requests from the public and bicycle shops in Berlin.
    With strong emphasis on using sustainable materials and practises, each Hangload is hand-made in Berlin.</p>
