    <h1>About Hangload</h1>

    <p>Hangload was invented by Darius Hajiani, a UK-expat living in Berlin. 
      He was looking for a better way to transport grocery bags by bicycle. 
      After researching, experimenting with different materials,and extensive testing, he came up with the patented Hangload system.</p>  

    <p>Invented and created in Berlin, Hangload was a finalist at the Innovation Price Berlin (Innovationpreis Berlin Brandenburg) 
      and garnered media interest.</p>

    <p>Hangload was invited to exhibit at the VeloBerlin generating much interest and requests from the public and bicycle shops in Berlin.
      With strong emphasis on using sustainable materials and practises, each Hangload is hand-made in Berlin.</p>

    <h1>How it works</h1>

    <p>Hangload is a versatile and practical system for carrying various loads on bicycles whether shopping or commuting.</p> 

    <p>
      Hangload can carry many different types of bags easily and safely while increasing freedom, flexibility 
      and convenience when traveling by bike.
    </p>

    <p>A Hangload consists of 2 parts:</p> 

    <ol class="max-width-2">
      <li>A unibody steel frame and panel which is attached to the side of the bike rack to keep any bag in safe distance to the bike’s chain, spokes, and pedals.</li>
      <li>A strong wooden toggle, to hang bags of various shapes and sizes.</li> 
    </ol>

    <p>The Hangload can be fitted onto either or both sides of a bicycle rack. 
      It provides a lean and elegant alternative to pannier bike bags or bike baskets.</p>
