        <p class="mt0">Hangload is a versatile and practical system for carrying various loads on bicycles whether shopping or commuting.</p> 

        <p>
          Hangload can carry many different types of bags easily and safely while increasing freedom, flexibility 
          and convenience when traveling by bike.
        </p>

        <p>A Hangload consists of 2 parts: An <strong>unibody steel frame</strong> and panel which is attached to the side of the bike rack 
          to keep any bag in safe distance to the bike’s chain, spokes, and pedals,
          and a <strong>strong wooden toggle</strong>, to hang bags of various shapes and sizes. </p> 

        <p>The Hangload can be fitted onto either or both sides of a bicycle rack. 
          It provides a lean and elegant alternative to pannier bike bags or bike baskets.</p>

      <p>Hangload is a unique, new and inexpensive alternative for carrying bags and rucksacks on the bicycle. 
        Bicycle baskets and bags are useful, but can restrict the type of bag or load that can be transported. </p>
      <p>Hangload is different: it provides a lean system to carry all types of bags of various shapes and sizes.
