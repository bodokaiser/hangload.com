  question: What is Hangload?
  answer: |
    Hangload is a unique, new and inexpensive alternative for carrying bags and rucksacks on the bicycle. Bicycle baskets and bags are useful, but can restrict the type of bag or load that can be transported.

    Hangload is different: it provides a lean system to carry all types of bags of various shapes and sizes, or even [drink crates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPxS3nGMboY). Thanks to Hangload, any bag can be a bicycle bag.
- id: components-uncommon
  question: The Hangload components look uncommon, please explain?
  answer: |
    In developing the Hangload many elements, materials and components were tested. It was probably the inventor's experience with sailing knots and equipment that helped him develop the robust and adjustable toggle used together with the bungee cords, which fasten with a simple knotting procedure (easier than tying shoe laces). We call this system **toggle&cord**.

    These fitting means prove most effective, strong and easy to use. They provide an additional and useful function for securing the bags further that no other embodiments can match---the Ariana technique:

    All of these components were invented by Darius Hajiani, you won't come across them anywhere else.
- id: who-creator
  question: Who is the creator?
  answer: |
    The Hangload system was invented by Darius Hajiani, inventor of English-Iranian background living in Berlin. He was looking for a better way to transport grocery bags by bicycle.  After researching, experimenting with different materials, and extensive testing, he came up with the Hangload system.

    Invented and created in Berlin, Hangload was a finalist at the Innovation Price Berlin (Innovationpreis Berlin Brandenburg) and garnered media interest.  

    Hangload was invited to exhibit at the Velo Berlin generating much interest and requests from the public and bicycle shops in Berlin.

    The design of the Hangload makes it easy to move according to your needs, e.g. taller people would want to slide it a bit further back to avoid interfering with their pedalling.
- id: how-much-weight
  question: How much weight can a Hangload carry?
  answer: |
    Hangload is sturdy, whether using only one or one on each side it can carry up to the maximum weight that your fitted luggage-rack is designed to carry. This is usually 25-30kg max. Please check your rack carrying capacity.

Hangload is a versatile and practical system for carrying various loads on bicycles whether shopping or commuting.

Hangload can carry many different types of bags easily and safely while increasing freedom, flexibility and convenience when travelling by bike.

A Hangload consists of 2 parts: A **unibody steel frame** and panel
which is attached to the side of the bike rack to keep any bag in safe distance to the bike’s chain, spokes, and pedals, and a **strong wooden toggle**, to hang bags of various shapes and sizes.

The Hangload can be fitted onto either or both sides of a bicycle rack. It provides a lean and elegant alternative to pannier bike bags or bike baskets.
