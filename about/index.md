  question: What is Hangload?
  answer: |
    Hangload is a unique, new and inexpensive alternative for carrying bags and rucksacks on the bicycle. Bicycle baskets and bags are useful, but can restrict the type of bag or load that can be transported.

    Invented and created in Berlin, Hangload was a finalist at the Innovation Price Berlin (Innovationpreis Berlin Brandenburg) and garnered media interest.
