    Hangload is a bag carrier for bicycles that can carry many different types of bags easily and safely, increasing freedom, flexibility and convenience. 

    It is not a container, like a bicycle basket or a bicycle bag, but more like an attachable side-rack. Hangload opens up many more possibilities as to the size, type and shape of bags that can be transported by bicycle. It can carry very large bags.

    A Hangload consists of 3 parts: A **unibody steel frame (1)** with banner, which is attached by **elasticated cords (2)** to the side of the bike rack to keep your bag at a safe distance from the bike’s chain, spokes, and pedals, and a **strong wooden toggle (3)**, to hang bags of various shapes and sizes.

    Our unique **toggle&cord** system is easy to use, has been tested thoroughly with heavy weights and is extremely robust and suitable for its purpose (watch the video to see how easy it works).

    The Hangload can be fitted onto either or both sides of a bicycle rack. It provides a lean and elegant alternative to pannier bike bags or bike baskets.

faq:
- id: why
  question: Why Hangload?
  answer: |
    Hangload is a unique, new and inexpensive alternative for carrying bags and rucksacks on the bicycle. Bicycle baskets and bags are useful, but can restrict the type of bag or load that can be transported.

    Hangload is different: it provides a lean system to carry all types of bags of various shapes and sizes, or even [drink crates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPxS3nGMboY). With Hangload, any bag can be a bicycle bag.
- id: components-uncommon
  question: The Hangload components look uncommon, please explain?
  answer: |
    In developing the Hangload many elements, materials and components were tested. It was probably Darius' experience with sailing knots and equipment that helped him develop the robust and adjustable toggle used together with the bungee cords, which fasten with a simple knotting procedure (easier than tying shoe laces). We call this system **toggle&cord**.

    These fitting means are unique to Hangload prove most effective, strong and easy to use. They provide an additional and useful function for securing the bags further that no other embodiments can match---the Ariana technique:

- id: who-creator
  question: Who's behind the Hangload?
  answer: |
    The Hangload system was developed by Darius Hajiani. He is of English-Iranian background, lives in Berlin, and was looking for a better way to transport grocery bags by bicycle. After researching, experimenting with different materials, and testing extensively, he came up with the Hangload system.

    Created and developed in Berlin, Hangload was a finalist at the Innovationspreis Berlin Brandenburg and garnered media interest.

    When exhibiting at the acclaimed VeloBerlin Expo, Hangload generated much interest and requests from the public and bicycle shops in Berlin.

- id: when-not-use
  question: When should I <span class="underline">NOT</span> use the Hangload?
  answer: |
    - When your bicycle wheels are smaller than 24 inches --- Hangload only works on bikes with wheels of 24 inches or larger.
    - When you have a mountain bike rack. Most mountain bike racks are only connected to the seat stay and usually have a 10 kg carrying capacity. Hangload only works with standard racks that are also connected to the rear wheel axle and have larger load capacity. 
    - When your bicycle rack/carrier is broken or fitted incorrectly --- the carrier of your rack should be parallel to the ground when fitted correctly.
    - When your bag is weak or damaged, or its handle does not fit onto the Hangload toggle properly. Make sure your bags are strong enough.
    - Hangload is not to be used in conjunction with bicycle child seats.
- id: where-attach
  question: Where on a bicycle can I attach a Hangload?
  answer: |
    Hangload is specifically designed to be attached to a bike’s rear rack or carrier.

    Do not mount it on the seat post carrier or the front rack.
- id: how-position
  question: How is the Hangload best positioned on a bike rack?
  answer: |
    The design of the Hangload makes it easy to move according to your needs, e.g. taller people would want to slide it a bit further back to avoid interfering with their pedalling.
- id: how-much-weight
  question: How much weight can a Hangload carry?
  answer: |
    Hangload is sturdy, whether using only one or one on each side it can carry up to the maximum weight that your fitted luggage-rack is designed to carry. This is usually 25-30kg max. Please check your rack carrying capacity.
- id: how-protect
  question: How can I protect my Hangload from getting stolen?
  answer: |
    Hangload is made of one closed steel frame with no bolts or screws attached. Just pass your bike lock or chain through the Hangload frame when locking your bike as shown below.
