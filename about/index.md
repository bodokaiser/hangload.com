- id: what-is
  question: What is Hangload?
  answer: |
    Hangload is a unique, new and inexpensive alternative for carrying bags and rucksacks on the bicycle. Bicycle baskets and bags are useful, but can restrict the type of bag or load that can be transported.

    Hangload is different: it provides a lean system to carry all types of bags of various shapes and sizes. Thanks to Hangload, any bag can be a bicycle bag.

  question: Who is the creator?
  answer: |
    Hangload was invented by Darius Hajiani, a UK-expat living in Berlin.  He was looking for a better way to transport grocery bags by bicycle.  After researching, experimenting with different materials, and extensive testing, he came up with the Hangload system.

    Invented and created in Berlin, Hangload was a finalist at the Innovation Price Berlin (Innovationpreis Berlin Brandenburg) and garnered media interest.  

    Hangload was invited to exhibit at the Velo Berlin generating much interest and requests from the public and bicycle shops in Berlin.
