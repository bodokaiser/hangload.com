  <br>
  <p class="text-justify">
    Some bags, especially shopping bags or some women handbags, have very long handles.
    If you would hang this on your Hangload Banner the bag dangling by the long handles and 
    possibly interfere with pedaling.
    To avoid this, wrap your bag handle around your rear rack and Hangload Banner toggle just as shown on the video and picture underneath.

    <p class="text-justify">
      An other option to use bags with long handles is to wrap the bag handle just a few times around the Hangload toggle that
      is attached to your rear rack. By shortening the bag is stable and secure on the panel 
      of the Hangload and you can safely continue riding your bike.

    <h3 class="text-center"> Use banner as bag </h3>
    <br>
    <p class="text-justify">
      We now have already received some feedback and heard from some that they would like to 
      use the banner of the stainless steel version as a bag to store eg Newspapers or the
      bike lock there. 
      <br>
      Newspapers or thicker magazines you can just plug in the banner without falling out. 
      However, in order to ensure this, we recommend that the Hangload banner is sewed up to glued or use a staple. 
      <br>
      It is essential that the banner can no longer be changed easily. Only in the unchanged state, 
      you can change your banner as you like.
