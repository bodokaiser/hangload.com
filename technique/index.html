<h3 class="text-center"> Bags with long handles (longer than 17 cm )  </h3>
<br>
<p class="text-justify">
        Some bags, especially cloth shopping bags or some women handbags, have very long handles.
		If you would hang this on your Hangload the bag dangling by the long handles and 
		possibly interfere with pedaling.
		<br>
		To avoid this, wrap the bag handle just a few times around the Hangload toggle that
		is attached to your carrier. By shortening the bag is stable and secure on the panel 
		of the Hangload and you can safely continue riding your bike.
