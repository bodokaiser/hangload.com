<h3 class="text-center"> Bags with long handles (longer than 17 cm )  </h3>
<br>
<p class="text-justify">
        Some bags, especially cloth shopping bags or some women handbags, have very long handles.
		If you would hang this on your Hangload the bag dangling by the long handles and 
		possibly interfere with pedaling.
		<br>
		To avoid this, wrap the bag handle just a few times around the Hangload toggle that
		is attached to your carrier. By shortening the bag is stable and secure on the panel 
		of the Hangload and you can safely continue riding your bike.

<h3 class="text-center"> Use banner as bag </h3>
<br>
<p class="text-justify">
        We now have already received some feedback and heard from some that they would like to 
		use the banner of the stainless steel version as a bag to store eg Newspapers or the
		bike lock there. 
		<br>
		Newspapers or thicker magazines you can just plug in the banner without falling out. 
		However, in order to ensure this, we recommend that the Hangload banner is sewed up to glued or use a staple. 
		<br>
		It is essential that the banner can no longer be changed easily. Only in the unchanged state, 
		you can change your banner as you like.
